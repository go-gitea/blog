---

We proudly present that we have released the third big version of Gitea v1.2.0. We have merged [676](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/milestone/3?closed=1) pull requests to release this version. You can download one of our pre-built binaries from our [downloads page](https://dl.gitea.io/gitea/1.2.0/), you just need to select the correct platform. For further details of the installation follow our [installation guide](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-from-binary/).

This version is delayed about six months and it's not obey our release cycle plan. We changed the Logo for a new design by voting. Many new features added like Status, 20+ OAuth2 and OpenID login, Team Units, GPG validation, Batch operation of issues and etc. Also we fixed about 200+ bugs on this release cycle and it spent our many time. For next release [v1.3.0](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/milestone/9), I wish we can reduce the PRs and release ASAP!
