We are happy to announce version 1.5.1 of Gitea has now been released. This
is a smaller release, with only 9 merged PRs, but it contains several
security related fixes and so we recommend upgrading whenever possible.

You can download one of our pre-built binaries from our
[downloads page](https://dl.gitea.io/gitea/1.5.1/) - make sure to select the
correct platform! For further details on how to install, follow our
[installation guide](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-from-binary/).

We'd like to thank Cezar97 for reporting the security issues that have been patched
in this release. Another thank you goes to all of our supporters on
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/gitea) who are also helping us
with financial sustainment.
