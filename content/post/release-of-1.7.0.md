The time has come for another major release! We are proud to present Gitea
1.7.0 to the world. In this release, we merged
[157 pull requests](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.7.0+is%3Amerged)
-- it's less than last time (178).

You can download one of our pre-built binaries from our
[downloads page](https://dl.gitea.io/gitea/1.7.0/) - make sure to select the
correct platform! For further details on how to install, follow our
[installation guide](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-from-binary/).

We'd like to thank all of our backers on
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/gitea), who are helping us deliver
a better piece of software.

With that out of the way, here's what's new on UI in 1.7.0:

<!--more-->

## User action heatmap ([#5131](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/5131))

![User action heatmap](/demos/5131/1.png)

Now user's action heatmap will be shown on your first login page and user's profile page.

_Thanks to [**@kolaente**](https://github.com/kolaente)_

## Show review summary in pull requests ([#5132](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/5132))

![Review summary in pull requests](/demos/5132/1.png)

A review summary now will be shown on the bottom of a pull request.

_Thanks to [**@kolaente**](https://github.com/kolaente)_

## Approvals at Branch Protection ([#5350](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/5350))

![approvals limitation](/demos/5350/1.png)

This PR adds approvals limitations to branch protection. A pull request could only be merged after serval approvals.

_Thanks to [**@jonasfranz**](https://github.com/jonasfranz)_

## Milestone issues and pull requests ([#5293](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/5293))

## Implement pasting image from clipboard for browsers that supports that ([#5317](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/5317))

![pasting image from clipboard](/demos/5317/1.gif)

Implemented pasting image from clipboard in new issue text area or adding issue/pr comments.

## Create Progressive Web App ([#4730](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/4730))

![progressive web app](/demos/4730/1.png)

This will allow users (especially on Android) to add the gitea website to the home-screen and use it like a native app.

_Thanks to [**@SohnyBohny**](https://github.com/SohnyBohny)_

## Give user a link to create PR after push ([#4716](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/4716))

When push to a remote non-default branch. It will display a useful link. Output of a push when no active PR exists:

```

# Help us out!

Gitea is focused on community input and contributions. To keep a project like
Gitea going we need people. **_LOTS_** of people. You can help in the
following areas:

## Programming

If you know Go or HTML/CSS/JavaScript, you may be interested in working on the
code. Working on OSS may seem scary, but the best way is to try! Read the
[Gitea contribution guide](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and then [find an itch to scratch](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues),
or scratch your own!

## Translating

Want to translate Gitea in your own language? Awesome! Join the Gitea project
on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gitea). As soon as your translation is
approved, it will be pushed to the Gitea project to be used in future releases!

## Documentation

Documentation is important, but also time consuming. If you enjoy writing and
have a pretty good knowledge of English, or you would like to translate the
English version to your native language, you're very welcome to do so. Find our
documentation on the main git repository
[here](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/tree/master/docs). Just fork, update
the documentation and then create a pull request!

## Support

Do you like people? Can you give calm and thought-out responses to users needing
help? Then you can spend some time providing support to those who need it. Most
answers can really be found in the documentation, so make sure to take some time
to read it. Then, either join our chat or forums (linked below), or simply
help us sort out issues and answer questions on the
[Gitea repository](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues).

## Donations

If you, or your company, want to help us out sustain our financial expenses, you
can do so by donating on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/gitea#).

## … or reporting bugs

If you lack the time or knowledge to do any of the above, just using Gitea and sharing the word is enough to make us happy! One thing you can always do is to report any bugs you find on the [Gitea issue tracker](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues).

Before opening an issue, read the [contribution guidelines about reporting bugs](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports). After opening an issue, try to stick around a while to answer any questions we might have. Replies greatly help us find the root cause of an issue.
