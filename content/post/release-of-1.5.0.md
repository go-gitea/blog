---

The time has come for another major release! We are happy to present Gitea
1.5.0 to the world. In this release, we merged
[258 pull requests](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.5.0+is%3Amerged)
-- just a bit more than last time (236).

You can download one of our pre-built binaries from our
[downloads page](https://dl.gitea.io/gitea/1.5.0/) - make sure to select the
correct platform! For further details on how to install, follow our
[installation guide](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-from-binary/).

We'd like to thank all of our backers on
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/gitea), who are helping us deliver
a better piece of software.

With that out of the way, here's what's new in 1.5.0:

<!--more-->

## Topics ([#3711](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3711))

![Topics demo](/demos/3711/1.gif)

You can now neatly organise your repositories using topics, similar to those
on GitHub.

_Thanks to [**@lunny**](https://github.com/lunny)_

## Emoji Completion ([#3433](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3433))

![Demo of emoji completion](/demos/3433/1.gif)

The issue editor will now provide suggestions for completing emojis when
starting to type an emoji shortcode - in a similar fashion to mention
autocompletion, which we added in 1.4.0.

_Thanks to [**@modmew8**](https://github.com/modmew8)_

## Global Code Search ([#3664](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3664))

![Screenshot of Global Code Search](/demos/3664/1.png)

We expanded our repo code search to allow for searching even MORE stuff - which
is to say, your entire Gitea instance! If you go on Explore, you will now be
able to search everywhere, **if you have code search enabled.**

_Thanks to [**@lunny**](https://github.com/lunny)_

## FIDO U2F Authentication ([#3971](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3971))

![](/demos/3971/1.gif)

Boost your security by adding FIDO U2F for authentication. ðŸš€

_Thanks to [**@JonasFranzDEV**](https://github.com/JonasFranzDEV)_

## Issue Due Date ([#3794](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3794))

![Screenshot of issue due dates in the issue listing](/demos/3794/1.png)
![Form to add a due date](/demos/3794/2.png)
![Added issue date](/demos/3794/3.png)

Deadlines: following them is both the Project Manager's dream and the
Developer's nightmare. But, time and again it has been proven that they are,
indeed, very useful, so now you can select due dates on issues to mark when they
_should_ be finished. Emphasis on the _should_ there.

_Thanks to [**@kolaente**](https://github.com/kolaente)_

## Multiple Assignees ([#3705](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3705))

![Screenshot of 2 people being assigned to an issue.](/demos/3705/1.png)

In Gitea 1.5.0, you'll be able to assign multiple people to a single issue.
For cases where you'll need more manpower in order to understand the cryptic
code left by old developers of the legacy codebase.

_Thanks to [**@kolaente**](https://github.com/kolaente)_

## Label Descriptions ([#3662](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3662))

![Label descriptions on the labels page](/demos/3662/1.png)

![Tooltip when hovering over a label](/demos/3662/2.png)
![Description is shown on the label picker as well](/demos/3662/3.png)

_Enhancement_ is a funny word, isn't it? It's sort of like a feature but it's
not as big as a feature. It might not be instantly clear to everyone who reads
it, but you can help them understand through the use of the new descriptions!

_Thanks to [**@lafriks**](https://github.com/lafriks)_

## Total Tracked Time ([#3341](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3341))

![Demo on a milestone](/demos/3341/1.png)

You can now track the total amount of time you spent on a single issue - or even
an entire milestone.

_Thanks to [**@JonasFranzDEV**](https://github.com/JonasFranzDEV)_

  [GPG Key,](http://pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=get&hash=on&fingerprint=on&search=0x2D9AE806EC1592E2)
  so you can be sure it's us.

# Help us out!

Gitea is focused on community input and contributions. To keep a project like
Gitea going we need people. **_LOTS_** of people. You can help in the
following areas:

## Programming

If you know Go or HTML/CSS/JavaScript, you may be interested in working on the
code. Working on OSS may seem scary, but the best way is to try! Read the
[Gitea contribution guide](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and then [find an itch to scratch](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues),
or scratch your own!

## Translating

Want to translate Gitea in your own language? Awesome! Join the Gitea project
on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gitea). As soon as your translation is
approved, it will be pushed to the Gitea project to be used in future releases!

## Documentation

Documentation is important, but also time consuming. If you enjoy writing and
have a pretty good knowledge of English, or you would like to translate the
English version to your native language, you're very welcome to do so. Find our
documentation on the main git repository
[here](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/tree/master/docs). Just fork, update
the documentation and then create a pull request!

## Support

Do you like people? Can you give calm and thought-out responses to users needing
help? Then you can spend some time providing support to those who need it. Most
answers can really be found in the documentation, so make sure to take some time
to read it. Then, either join our chat or forums (linked below), or simply
help us sort out issues and answer questions on the
[Gitea repository](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues).

## Donations

If you, or your company, want to help us out sustain our financial expenses, you
can do so by donating on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/gitea#).

## â€¦ or reporting bugs

If you lack the time or knowledge to do any of the above, just using Gitea and sharing the word is enough to make us happy! One thing you can always do is to report any bugs you find on the [Gitea issue tracker](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues).

Before opening an issue, read the [contribution guidelines about reporting bugs](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports). After opening an issue, try to stick around a while to answer any questions we might have. Replies greatly help us find the root cause of an issue.
